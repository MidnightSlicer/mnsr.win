# About **ME**

Hello! My name is Dylan. I am a christian, computer enthusiast and software developer in college (graduating soon!). I grew up in a rural area of America and I hope to never leave it. I am a passionate person who cares about privacy and freedom. I created this blog to express myself freely and share knowledge. I find I am able to process thoughts better when I write them down. I also find myself sharing the same information with family and friends a lot and thought it may be a good thing to just put guides and such in blog so I can just send them a link. If other people find this, welcome! I will not play any SEO games (other than basic submission to major search engines) because I have wasted enough time doing that I and I am writing here only for me.

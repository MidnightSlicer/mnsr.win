# About Me

Hello! My name is Dylan! Welcome to my blog. A little about myself... I am a Christian ✝️, I am an American 🇺🇸, I am a computer enthusiast 🖳, and I am a software developer 🖮. I care a lot about personal privacy and freedom. My goal is to make privacy and freedom accessible to anyone by creating guides and offering suggestions on this blog. 

I grew up on a small farm in a rural part of the country and I love it. I have worked on a ranch around cattle and other animals, and I love being outside. I am studying for a Bachelors in software development, and I am excited to graduate soon.
Anyway, welcome to my blog! Take a look around and enjoy the content. I have funny stuff, thought experiments, and of course, guides. Enjoy!

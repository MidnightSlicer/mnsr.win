		<title>Hello World!</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023-09-27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog! I have always wanted to have a blog of my own, and that desire was spurred on by my decision to leave social media. I love writing and I needed a place to express that love that was mine. When I became aware of open source, freedom, privacy, and all that other cool stuff I wanted to not only use a platform free of spyware, but I also wanted to &lt;em&gt;own the platform&lt;/em&gt;. I have expressed that already by running my own Minecraft server, Matrix server, and a few other servers for me and my friends, so to me a website is kinda the logical next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, enjoy your stay, enjoy the reading, and enjoy the learning!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

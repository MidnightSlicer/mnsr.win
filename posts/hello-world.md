# Hello World!

2023-09-27

Welcome to my blog! I have always wanted to have a blog of my own, and that desire was spurred on by my decision to leave social media. I love writing and I needed a place to express that love that was mine. When I became aware of open source, freedom, privacy, and all that other cool stuff I wanted to not only use a platform free of spyware, but I also wanted to *own the platform*. I have already expressed that by running my own Minecraft server, Matrix server, and a few other servers for my friends and I, so to me a website is kinda the logical next step.

So please, enjoy your stay, enjoy the reading, and enjoy the learning!

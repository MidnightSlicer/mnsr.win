# I like Arch BTW - A short-term review of Arch Linux

2023-11-22

I like [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). I switched from [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) to Arch in July of 2023 and so far I really enjoy it. Arch Linux, or Arch, is a Linux distro that allows the user to have as much customization as possible, while still being useful. There are a lot of myths that Arch is unstable or breaks all the time, but so far I have not experienced that. One time my desktop didn't work when I logged in after an update, but that was on my Window Manager, [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). It was also an easy config file fix and I was up and running again. Arch Linux allows me to tinker with my computer unlike any other distro or operating system I have ever used. This post is not to get you to use Arch, it is just to talk about how I feel about it after a short time using it.

## What I Expect from my Computer

Something I often find missing in distro reviews is a basic understanding of how the reviewer uses his computer. I am just going to do a basic outline of what I expect my computer to do for me and what I will tolerate. Right now, since I am in school, my main application is LibreOffice Writer. That application is almost always open. I used the Flatpak version for a while, but it started acting weird with Hyprland, so I switched to the AUR version and that helped. 

## "You will use Microsoft Edge and you will be happy" - Bill Gates (maybe)

Turns out, something in my brain head didn't like being told how to use the computer I bought by the people that payed massive sums of money to be installed on my computer when I unboxed it. Every time I ran a Windows update it would break my custom Start Menu layout, unpin my apps from the task bar, add the stupidest browser of all time to my desktop, and just engage in general tomfoolery on my *perfect* system. I did registry tweaks, but that shouldn't be a factor. I tried to uninstall Microsoft Edge once, only for it to reappear upon boot. I used WinAeroTweaker to do all kinds of **funny stuff** (e.g. stuff Big Brother does not approve of) to my system, but no matter what I did it was all for nothing. It was inevitably reset. (I seem to have hijacked my own blog post)

If you are getting major ADHD or OCD vibes, you are probably right. I have discovered over the years and with the help of others that I... am a perfectionist... I know this may shock you, but it is true. There was always something about my computer that drove me nearly mad, but I could never place it. I remember learning about Windows 11 (most of my experience at the time was Windows 10, mind you) and just thinking stuff like *"Why?"* and *"I don't want that!"*. My whole family, of course, doesn't care, and just wants to turn on their computer and do their thing. Nothing wrong with that, but that ain't me chief. I have finally deduced that the way Microsoft controls your computer and breaks stuff all the time actually wore on me mentally. It took a few months of using Arch to finally figure this out, but I think the theory holds water.

## What do I Think?

Anyway (I hope you like reading as much as I like writing)

# I like Arch - A short-term review of Arch Linux

2023-09-30

I like Arch Linux. I switched from Fedora Workstation to Arch in July of 2023 and so far I really enjoy it. Arch Linux is a Linux distro that allows the user to have as much customization as possible, while still being useful. There are a lot of myths that Arch is unstable or breaks all the time, but so far I have not experienced that. One time my desktop didn't work when I logged in after an update, but that was on my Window Manager, Hyprland. It was also an easy config file fix and I was up and running again. Arch Linux allows me to tinker with my computer unlike any other distro or operating system ever has.
